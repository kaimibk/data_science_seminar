## Data Science Seminar

Welcome to the Society of Physics Students (SPS@UHM) Data Science Seminar. We will introduce scientific computing with Python, programming fundamentals, and give you the tools to succeed in data science research or industry.

We will be covering topics, such as...

- Introduction to Python
- Data Visualization
- Applications of Machine Learning Algorithms such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines
- Bayesian Data Analysis
- Data Warehouse Management

... and the list goes on!
